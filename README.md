# Problem Dev 1


This problem's infrastructure is based on the "general-ssh" example found in the [picoCTF/start-problem-dev](https://github.com/picoCTF/start-problem-dev/tree/master/example-problems/general-ssh) github page.

Run this example with cmgr to be able to playtest it.

If you are playtesting, you can run the generic solver:
`python3 solution_general.py SSH_PORT PASSWORD`
